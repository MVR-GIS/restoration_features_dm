    "text": "Problem\nData integration across USACE is hamstrung by a lack of data stardardization policies and procedures. As a result, data systems are not consistently or thoroughly documented. This leads to a vicious cycle: as data systems proliferate, interoperability declines. USACE is not alone in this problem.\n\nOne problem is that data are insufficiently described to understand what they are or how they were produced. A second issue is that no single vocabulary provides all key metadata fields required to support basic scientific use cases. A third issue is that data catalogs and data repositories all use different metadata standards, if they use any standard at all, and this prevents easy search and aggregation of data. Therefore, we need a guide to indicate what are the essential metadata for a dataset description, and the manner in which we can express it.\n\nDataset Descriptions: HCLS Community Profile, W3C Interest Group Note 14 May 2015: https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/"

Use the top menu to explore the details of each step.\n\nExtract Schema\n\nThis step of the process extracts the database schema from the running RDMS.\nThe RDMS schema is then converted into Resource Description Format (RDF) format.\nThis project will use Terse RDF known as Turtle.\n\n\n\nAssign Standards\n\n\nAdd Metadata\n\n\nValidate"
